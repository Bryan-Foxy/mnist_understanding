    "This notebook was created on *April 23, 2024, at 19:08*  with the intention of providing detailed explanations and interpretations of the processes involved. While Python scripts are powerful, they can sometimes be complex and require a significant investment in terms of analysis and understanding. This document aims to simplify this task by breaking down and explaining each code segment in detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will undertake to revisit and detail the implementations of the MNIST dataset, a dataset widely used in the machine learning community, initially popularized by Yann LeCun. The goal is to implement two types of neural architectures: a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). We will then compare their performances through various metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, special attention will be given to visualizing backpropagation to identify the global optimum. This approach aims to illustrate not only how modifications to the weights affect model accuracy during training but also to demonstrate optimization dynamics in action.\n",
    "\n",
    "This work is essential for those looking to deepen their understanding of deep learning fundamentals as well as for those wishing to refine their ability to optimize machine learning algorithms."
